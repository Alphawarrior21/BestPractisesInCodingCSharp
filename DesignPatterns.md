# <span style="color:blue"> Design Patterns </span>
This repo highlights best practices for creating safe, simple, and maintainable software, especially in C#. It views coding as both an art and a philosophy, and stresses the importance of using techniques and tools for code analysis to ensure high-quality development.

## Understanding the design patterns and their purpose.
While implementing a good solution, how would one will make sure that solution is great in terms for reusability,good performance, and good maintainability etc. The answer is by choosing a good design pattern which not only provide a solution to the problem but is efficient in every way possible.

### Highlights of SOLID principles
- Single Responsibility: A module or function should be responsible for a single purpose.
- Open-Closed: A software artifact should be open for extensionbut closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution: The behavior of a program needs to remain unchanged when you substitute one of its components for another component that has been defined by a supertype of the primer object.
- Interface Segregation: Depending on the way you create interfaces, you will promote dependencies that do not necessarily occur when you build their concrete objects, causing harm to the system architecture.
- Dependency Inversion: The most flexible systems are the ones where object dependencies only refer to abstractions.

### Highlights of the design patterns
- Asynchronous Request-Reply
- Bulkhead Isolation
- Cache-Aside
- Circuit Breaker
- Command Query Responsibilty Segregation (CQRS)
- Publisher/Subscriber
- Retry
- Queue- Based Load leveling
